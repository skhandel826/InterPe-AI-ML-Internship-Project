# InterPe-AI-ML-Internship-Project
# AI/ML Internship Projects Repository

This repository contains the projects I developed during my AI/ML internship, focusing on applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. The projects showcase my understanding of data analysis, model building, and practical implementation of AI/ML concepts.

## Projects Included:

### Diabetes Prediction  
A machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical data. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models using classification algorithms.

### Quikr Car Price Analysis  
An end-to-end analysis of used car listings from Quikr to understand price trends, key factors affecting car prices, and predictive modeling to estimate car values based on features.

### IPL Matches Analysis  
Data analysis and visualization of IPL matches to derive insights such as team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes using Python libraries and exploratory data analysis techniques.
